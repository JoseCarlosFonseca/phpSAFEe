# phpSAFEe
phpSAFEe is an extension of phpSAFE that is configured for searching vulnerabilities in all files of multiple projects in a base source code folder (default: source). Each project is in a separate folder. phpSAFEe begins with an overview of the projects in the source code folder. It includes the name of the project, the total number of files in the project, an hyperlink (Browser) to run the tool for all files and a shell command (sh) to run the tool in a console. By clicking on the total number of files in the project, it showed an hyperlinked list of all files that compose the project. Each hyperlink allows you to view the source code in the web browser. Running the tool for all files of a project is as easy as clicking in the Browser's hyperlink of the project. The results are outputted in a folder with the same of the project located in a base folder (default: output). The results include HTML files with details about the vulnerabilities and hyperlinks to view and navigate to the vulnerable line of code. The results also include a CSV file and SQL file with INSERT commands with details of the vulnerabilities reported. These files aim to facilitate the integration/usage of the results in other tools such as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) like SQLMap.
